The simplest way to verify this code pulls from SWAPI is to run the files in a basic http server.

Necessary files are
index.html
app.js
controller.js

the service.js file needs to be worked on.

I ran the basic node http-server command in the document root (root for the web files) and browsed to localhost:8180 where I have my node http-server defined.
